# Silicon-Labs-Bluetooth
Silicon Labs is one of the leading manufacturers of Semiconductor devices in the world. Recently, they are focusing more and more on IoT based products. They have excellent Bluetooth Low Energy kits which can be used to provide great IoT solutions. This repository is a collection of simple bluetooth tasks using mostly BGM220 kits. Recently they have gone through a version change in Bluetooth SDK (from SDK version 2.13 to version 3.1). As a result, it can be a challenge for beginners to get started with the simple Bluetooth operation tasks. Keeping this view in mind, to facilitate the journey for the beginners, this repository is created.

I am greatly indebted to Silicon labs official github repository and their old version documents to make this repository a success. It should be made clear that this repository in no way an alternative to amazing knowledge base that Silicon Labs already have. It is created just to give beginners a quickstart in creating simple bluetooth tasks like server-client operation etc., so that they don't have to go through the hassles of searching through documents.

I will try to update this repository as I explore more and more. Any kind of feedback which will help me to grow is appreciated.
